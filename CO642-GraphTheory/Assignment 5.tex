\subsection*{a}
\paragraph{}
Let $k \in \Z$ such that $k \geq 0$. Choose $n = R(k)$. By Ramsey's Theorem $n$ exists. Let $T$ be a tournament on $n$ vertices. Number the vertices arbitrarily. That is write $V(T) = \{1, \dots, n\}$. Color the edges of $T$ as follows: for every $(i,j) \in E(T)$, if $i<j$ color $(i,j)$ red and otherwise (that is, if $i>j$) color $(i,j)$ blue. Now by the definition of $R(k)$, $T$ contains either a red $K_k$ or blue $K_k$.
\paragraph{}
Suppose that $T$ contains a red $K_k$. Let $T'$ be directed subgraph of $T$ induced by the red $K_k$. We claim that $T'$ is an acyclic tournament. Clearly, $T'$ is an orientation of $K_k$ so it remains to show $T'$ is acyclic. Suppose for a contradiction that $T'$ has a directed cycle $C$. Let $(i,j) \in E(C)$. Since $(i,j)$ is red, $i < j$. Since $(i,j) \in E(C)$, $P = C -(i,j)$ is a directed $j-i$ path.
\paragraph{Claim 1.1}
For all $i,j \in V(T')$, if $P$ be a directed monochromatic red $j-i$ path then $j<i$.
\paragraph{Proof of Claim 1.1}
Proceed by induction on $|E(P)|$. If $|E(P)| = 1$ then $(j,i)$ is a red arc. So $j<i$. Suppose for induction that for all directed monochromatic red $j-l$ paths $P'$ if $1\leq |E(P')| < |E(P)|$ then $j<l$. Let $(l,i) \in E(P)$. Then $l \neq j$ since $1 < |E(P)|$. Since $(l,i)$ is a red arc, $l<i$. Now $jPl$ is a directed monochromatic red $j-l$ path such that $1\leq |E(jPl)| < |E(P)|$, so by the induction hypothesis $j<l$. Thus by transitivity $j < i$. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction for all $i,j \in V(T')$, if $P$ be a directed monochromatic red $j-i$ path then $j<i$. $\blacksquare$
\paragraph{}
Now $P$ is a directed monchromatic red $j-i$ path, so by Claim $1.1$, $j<i$. But then we have $i<j$ and $j<i$. That is, by transitivity $i<i$, a contradiction. Thus $T'$ has no directed cycle. Therefore $T'$ is acyclic.
\paragraph{}
Suppose that $T$ contains a blue $K_k$. This case is symmetric to the red case, but it is included for completeness. Let $T'$ be directed subgraph of $T$ induced by the blue $K_k$. We claim that $T'$ is an acyclic tournament. Clearly, $T'$ is an orientation of $K_k$ so it remains to show $T'$ is acyclic. Suppose for a contradiction that $T'$ has a directed cycle $C$. Let $(i,j) \in E(C)$. Since $(i,j)$ is blue, $i > j$. Since $(i,j) \in E(C)$, $P = C -(i,j)$ is a directed $j-i$ path.
\paragraph{Claim 1.2}
For all $i,j \in V(T')$, if $P$ be a directed monochromatic blue $j-i$ path then $j>i$.
\paragraph{Proof of Claim 1.1}
Proceed by induction on $|E(P)|$. If $|E(P)| = 1$ then $(j,i)$ is a blue arc. So $j>i$. Suppose for induction that for all directed monochromatic blue $j-l$ paths $P'$ if $1\leq |E(P')| < |E(P)|$ then $j>l$. Let $(l,i) \in E(P)$. Then $l \neq j$ since $1 < |E(P)|$. Since $(l,i)$ is a blue arc, $l>i$. Now $jPl$ is a directed monochromatic blue $j-l$ path such that $1\leq |E(jPl)| < |E(P)|$, so by the induction hypothesis $j>l$. Thus by transitivity $j > i$. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction for all $i,j \in V(T')$, if $P$ be a directed monochromatic blue $j-i$ path then $j>i$. $\blacksquare$
\paragraph{}
Now $P$ is a directed monchromatic blue $j-i$ path, so by Claim $1.2$, $j>i$. But then we have $i>j$ and $j>i$. That is, by transitivity $i>i$, a contradiction. Thus $T'$ has no directed cycle. Therefore $T'$ is acyclic. Thus for all nonnegative integers $k$ there is an integer $n$ such that every tournament on $n$ vertices contains an acyclic tournament on $k$ vertices. $\blacksquare$
\subsection*{b}
\paragraph{}
We proceed by induction on $k$ to show that for all $k\in \Z$ such that $k\geq 0$, if $n = \ceil{2^{k-1}}$ and $T$ is a tournament on $n$ vertices then $T$ contains an acyclic tournament on $k$ vertices. If $k=0$ then $n = \ceil{2^{-1}} = 0$ and the result holds trivially. If $k=1$ then $n = \ceil{2^0} =1$. Any tournament on one vertex is acyclic so again the result holds trivially. 
\paragraph{}
Now let $k \in \Z$ and suppose for induction that for all $j \in \Z$ such that $0 \leq j < k$, if $n = \ceil{2^{j-1}}$ and $T$ is a tournament on $n$ vertices then $T$ contains an acyclic tournament on $j$ vertices. Let $T$ be a tournament on $n=\ceil{2^{k-1}} = 2^{k-1}$ vertices. Let $v \in V(T)$. Let $N^+(v) = \{(v,u):u \in V(T)\}$ and let $N^-(v) = \{(u,v): u\in V(T)\}$. Let $$N^*(v) = argmax_{N \in \{N^+(v), N^-(v)\}}\{|N|\}.$$
Then $\ceil{\frac{n}{2}} \leq |N^*(v)| \leq \ceil{n}-1$. That is, $\ceil{2^{k-2}} \leq |N^*(v)| \leq \ceil{2^{k-1}} - 1$. Let $N$ be a size $\ceil{2^{k-2}}$ subset of $N^*(v)$. Then strictly either all arcs from $v$ are forward to vertices in $N$ or all arcs from $v$ are backward to vertices in $N$. Let $T' = T[N]$. Then $0\leq |V(T')| = \ceil{2^{k-2}} < n$ and so by the induction hypothesis $T'$ contains an acyclic tournament on $k-1$ vertices. Let $T^*$ be such a tournament. Then $T^* + v$ is a tournament on $k$ vertices.
\paragraph{}
Suppose for a contradiction that $T^* + v$ contains a directed cycle $C$. Since $T^*$ is acyclic, $v \in V(C)$. Consider the arcs $(u,v), (v,w) \in E(C)$ for $u,w \in V(T^*) = N$. Such arcs exists since $C$ is a directed cycle containing $v$. But then there is a forward arc from $v$ to a vertex in $N$ and a backward arc from $v$ to a vertex in $N$, a contradiction since all arcs from $v$ to vertices of $N$ were chosen to have the same direction. Therefore $T^* + v$ is an acyclic tournament on $k$ vertices. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction for all $k\in \Z$ such that $k\geq 0$, if $n = \ceil{2^{k-1}}$ and $T$ is a tournament on $n$ vertices then $T$ contains an acyclic tournament on $k$ vertices. Therefore for all nonnegative integers $k$ there is an integer $n$ such that every tournament on $n$ vertices contains an acyclic tournament on $k$ vertices. $\blacksquare$
