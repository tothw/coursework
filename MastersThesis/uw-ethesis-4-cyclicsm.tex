\chapter{Cyclic Stable Matching}
%======================================================================
This chapter describes the cyclic stable matching problem as posed by Knuth. We give some sufficient conditions for a matching to be stable in this context. We describe a computer search procedure for deciding if all preference systems of a certain size have a cyclic stable matching or finding a counterexample should one exist.
