\paragraph{}
Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph. Suppose that $G$ is connected and that every node, $v$, is inessential. Let $v \in V$. We will show that $G-v$ has a perfect matching. Let $M$ be a maximal matching in $G$ such that $v$ is $M$-exposed. Such a matching exists as $v$ is inessential. 
\paragraph{}
Let $w\in V\backslash \{v\}$. Suppose for contradiction that $w$ is $M$-exposed. Since $G$ is connected there is a $vw$-path in $G$, call it $P$. Since $w$ is $M$-exposed there exists an $M$-exposed vertex in $V(P)$. Let $w'$ be the $M$-exposed vertex nearest to $v$ along the path $P$.
\paragraph{}
Suppose for contradiction that $vPw'$ (the subpath of $P$ from $v$ to $w'$) is not $M$-alternating. Then there exists an $M$-exposed vertex $u$ not equal to $v$ or $w'$, as otherwise every edge alternates being in $M$ and not being in $M$. But $vPu$ is a shorter path than $vPw'$ contradicting the minimality of $w'$. Thus $vPw'$ is $M$-alternating.
\paragraph{}
Since $vPw'$ is $M$-alternating and both $v$ and $w'$ are $M$-exposed, $vPw'$ is an $M$-augmenting path. But by the Augmenting Path Theorem this contradicts the maximality of $M$. Thus for all $w \in V\backslash \{v\}$, $w$ is not $M$-exposed. Therefore $M$ covers every vertex in $V\backslash \{v\}$. Since $v$ is $M$-exposed, $\delta(v) \cap M = \emptyset$. Therefore $M$ is a perfect matching in $G-v$.
\paragraph{}
Now for all $v \in V$, $G-v$ has a perfect matching. Therefore $G$ is factor critical. To conclude that $\nu(G) = (|V| - 1)/2$ observe two things. First any perfect matching of $G-v$ is a matching in $G$ so $\nu(G) \geq (|V|-1)/2$. Also $|V\backslash \{v\}|$ is even as otherwise a perfect matching does not exist. Thus $|V|$ is odd. Now, secondly, observe that by the Tutte-Berge formula (as an inequality) we have $\nu(G) \leq \frac{1}{2}(|V| - oc(G) + |\emptyset|) = (|V| - 1 + 0)/2 = (|V| - 1)/2$. Therefore $\nu(G) = (|V|-1)/2$. $\blacksquare$

\section*{3}
Let $B$ be the set of inessential nodes in a given undirected graph $G$. Let $C$ be the set of essential neighbours of $B$, and let $D$ be all remaining nodes.
\subsection*{a}
\paragraph{Lemma 3.1}
Let $v \in C$. Let $M'$ be a maximal matching in $G' = G-v$. Let $M$ be a maximal matching in $G$. Then $|M'| + 1 = |M|$.
\paragraph{Proof of Lemma 3.1}
The matching $M'$ is a matching in $G$ where $v$ is $M'$-exposed. Since $v$ is essential $M'$ is not a maximal matching in $G$. Therefore $|M'| < |M|$. That is, $|M'| + 1 \leq |M|$ since the size of sets is integral. Suppose for contradiction that $|M| \geq |M'| + 2$. Then let $e=vu \in M$. Such an edge exists since $M$ is maximal and $v$ is essential. Now $|M\backslash\{e\}| = |M| - 1 \geq |M'| + 1$. But then $M\backslash\{e\}$ is a matching in $G'$ of larger size than $M'$, contradicting the maximality of $M'$. Therefore $|M| < |M'| +2$. That is $|M| \leq |M'| + 1$. So $|M'| + 1 \leq |M| \leq |M'|+1$, and thus $|M| = |M'| + 1$. $\blacksquare$
\paragraph{}
Let $G' = G-v$ be the graph obtained from $G$ by removing node $v \in C$. Let $B'$ be the set of inessential nodes of $G'$, let $C'$ be the set of essential neighbours of $B'$, and let $D'$ be the remaining nodes of $G'$.
\paragraph{}
Let $b \in B$. Since $b$ is inessential for $G$ there exists a maximal matching $M$ of $G$ such that $b$ is $M$-exposed. Now $v$ is essential for $G$ so $v$ is $M$-covered. Therefore there exists $e=vu \in M$. Now $M\backslash\{e\}$ is a $G'$ matching where $b$ is $M\backslash\{e\}$-exposed. Suppose for contradiction that $M\backslash\{e\}$ is not maximal for $G'$. That is that there exists a maximal matching $M'$ for $G'$ such that $|M\backslash\{e\}| < |M'|$. Then $|M| - 1 < |M'|$, that is $|M| < |M'| + 1$. Since size of matchings are integral, $|M| \leq |M'|$. Now $E(M') \subseteq E(G') \subseteq E(G)$. Thus $M'$ is a matching of $G$. Since $M$ is a maximal matching for $G$, $|M'| \leq |M|$. Thus $|M'| = |M|$. Thus $M'$ is a maximal matching for $G$. But $M'$ is a $G'$ matching, so $v$ is $M'$-exposed. Therefore there is a maximal matching of $G$ where $v$ is exposed, contradicting that $v$ is essential for $G$. So $M\backslash\{e\}$ is maximal for $G'$. Since $b$ is $M\backslash\{e\}$-exposed $b$ is inessential for $G'$, that is $b \in B'$. Therefore $B \subseteq B'$. 
\paragraph{}
Let $b \in B'$. Suppose for contradiction that $b \not\in B$. Let $u \in \delta(v) \cap B$. Such a $u$ exists by the definition of $C$. Let $M$ be a maximal matching in $G$ such that $u$ in $M$-exposed. Let $M'$ be a maximal matching in $G'$ such that $b$ is $M'$-exposed. Then $M'$ is a matching in $G$ where $v$ is $M'$-exposed and $b$ is $M'$-exposed. By Lemma $3.1$, $|M'| + 1 = |M|$.
\paragraph{}
Now consider the graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $M \triangle M'$. If $u$ is $M'$-exposed then $M' \cup \{uv\}$ is a matching in $G$ as $v$ is $M'$-exposed. Such a matching is maximal as $|M' \cup \{uv\}| = |M'| + 1 = |M|$. Thus $u$ is $M'$-covered. Let $P$ be the path in this graph starting at $u$. The edges of $P$ alternate between $M'$ and $M$. If $P$ terminates at an $M$-exposed vertex then $P$ is an $M$-augmenting path in $G$, contradicting the maximality of $M$. So $P$ ends at an $M'$-exposed vertex. Since $b$ and $v$ are $M'$-exposed, they are not internal vertices of $P$. hence either $b$ is not an endpoint of $P$ or $v$ is not an endpoint of $P$.
\paragraph{}
If $b$ is not an endpoint of $P$ then $M' \triangle P$ is a maximal matching of $G$ (as it is a matching and $|M' \triangle P| = |M'| + 1 = |M|$) such that $b$ is $M' \triangle P$-exposed. This contradicts that $b$ is essential in $G$. So $v$ is not an endpoint of $P$. Then similarly, $M' \triangle P$ is a maximal matching of $G$ such that $v$ is $M' \triangle P$-exposed. This contradicts that $v$ is essential in $G$. Thus $b \in B$, that is $B' \subseteq B$.
\paragraph{}
Since $B \subseteq B'$ and $B' \subseteq B$, $B = B'$. Then $C' = \{ \text{essential neighbours of $B'$ in $G'$}\} = \{\text{essential neighbours of $B$ in $G-v$} \} = C \backslash \{ v \}$. Further $D' = V\backslash \{ v\} \backslash (\{ B' \cup C' \} ) = V\backslash \{ v\} \backslash (B \cup (C\backslash \{ v\} )) = D$. Therefore the Gallai-Edmonds partition of $G'$ is $B,C\backslash \{v\}, D$. $\blacksquare$ 
\subsection*{b}
\paragraph{Lemma 3.2}
For all $S \subseteq C$, the Gallai-Edmonds partition of $G\backslash S$ is $B, C\backslash S, D$.
\paragraph{Proof of Lemma 3.2}
Proceed by induction on $|S|$. If $|S|  = 0$ then $S = \emptyset$ and the lemma is immediate. Suppose the lemma holds for all subsets of size less that $|S|$. Let $v \in S$. Then $G\backslash S = G\backslash (S \backslash \{v\}) - v$. By induction the Gallai-Edmonds partition of $G\backslash (S\backslash \{v\})$ is $\{B, C\backslash (S\backslash \{v\}), D \}$. So by $3a$ the Gallai-Edmonds partition of $G\backslash (S \backslash \{v\}) - v = G\backslash S$ is $\{B, C\backslash (S\backslash \{v\})\backslash \{v\}, D\} = \{V, C\backslash S, D\}$. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction the lemma holds. $\blacksquare$
\paragraph{Corollary 3.2}
Every vertex of $G[B]$ is inessential and every vertex of $G[D]$ is essential.
\paragraph{Proof of Corollary 3.2}
Let $S = C$. By Lemma $3.2$, $G\backslash C$ has Gallai-Edmonds partition $\{B, \emptyset, D\}$. But $G \backslash C = G[B] \dot \cup G[D]$. Thus $G[B]$ has Gallai-Edmonds partition $\{B, \emptyset, ]\emptyset\}$ and $G[D]$ has Gallai-Edmonds partition $\{\emptyset, \emptyset, D\}$. That is, every vertex of $G[B]$ is inessential and every vertex of $G[D]$ is essential. $\blacksquare$
\paragraph{}
Let $G'$ be a connected component of $G[B]$. By Corollary $3.2$ every vertex of $G[B]$ is inessential, so every vertex of $G'$ is inessential. Further $G'$ is connected by $(2)$, so $G'$ is factor critical. By Corollary $3.2$ every vertex of $G[D]$ is essential so in any maximal matching every vertex of $G[D]$ is covered, that is $G[D]$ has a perfect matching. $\blacksquare$
